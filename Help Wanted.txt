Want to join in on the fun?

Are you a programmer?  Aleph One 1.3 needs to become stable for distribution.
For example, M1 Redux relies on MML scripting to play level music, but there is
a bug that crashes games on maps like this in the current stable release, which
has been fixed in 1.3.  I've submitted a music patch that could use some
support, and it's possible Lua updates might make it into the next version.

Just a player?  Tell me what you want improved, report bugs, point out mistakes.
Point out to me where I've got a bouncy polygon, sticky line, or bad monster path,
so I know where to go in Weland and fix it.

Are you proficient with Forge/Weland?  Help me design missions to take place on
the colony moon!  The Jjaro set is intended for natural and Jjaro areas on the
colony, while Marathon textures would suit human settlements.  Or, take an
original M1 level and improve it or work on lighting & texture alignment.

Are you a 2-D artist?  Re-drawn chapter screens would be awesome!  As would be
terminal art, especially for the rampant AIs and the Pfhor, for whom I'd like to
have terminals in colour and more detailed than Leela's.

Are you a writer?  I'd love to have some community-written terminals.  As yet
the new plots are but vaugely planned, so propose your vision!

Are you a 3-D artist?  You could work on scenery, items, or possibly even
monsters- the Juggernaut especially could use a 3D treatment.  Working on this
would benefit the wider Marathon community!

Are you proficient with Lua?  I've learned a lot about Lua from working on
Eternal, but I'm far from an expert on the subject. I could especially use some
help creating an floating HUD, see Extras/HUD.xcf for the planned layout.

Are you a sonic artist?  How about some new sounds for the chapter screens?

Whatever your talents, remember to stay true to the aesthetic and spirit of the
original games.  Let me know if you'd like to do any of the above or have any
other ideas over on the Pfhorums, the Story Forum, or the Marathon discord!

The following is a list of object names, as they are used in M1 Redux, what M1A1
uses for that slot if applicable, and what Infinity uses in that slot if
different from M1 Redux.  See the "For Weland" folder for files you can use to
make Weland use the right names for Redux.
