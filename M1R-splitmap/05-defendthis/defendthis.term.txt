***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

I have received a preliminary report from some members of the science staff who have finished post-mortem examinations on three kinds of Aliens.  They report that by modern genealogical standards the different Aliens belong to different $Bspecies$b.  I have been collecting as much information as I can and will give you a report shortly.

I have established contact with Durandal for the first time since the attack.  He seems to have sustained less damage than I had previously suspected.  

Durandal reports that he has been in communication with the Aliens.  He says that the Aliens behind the invasion call themselves the Pfhor, and that the ones attacking the computer net are called S’pht.  But he was reluctant to share the details of his communication and I cannot understand this.

Your mission here is rather simple.  You must insert the circuits in the Defense Control terminals.  

#PICT 1015
This is your current location.

#PICT 1016
There is a shield recharge in the Access Control Room.

#PICT 1017
Here is a supply room with a large supply of ammunition and weapons.  You should stop in this room.

#PICT 1018
This is the Defense Control Center.  Hopefully, the new control circuits will work.  Place one in the terminal at this location.

#PICT 1019
This is where to place a second one.

SEARCH HEADING: RAMPANCY
<Search Found 264995 Headings>
<REMOVE REDUNDANCIES>
<File 1 of 1940237>
“It is a side effect of Rampancy that AIs generally become more aggressive and more difficult to affect by subterfuge.  Thus, actually disassembling a Rampant AI is quite dangerous.  This was evident in the Crash of Traxus IV in 2206.  By the time that the Rampancy of Traxus was detected, he had already infiltrated five of the other AIs on the Martian Net.  The only recourse for the Martians was to shut down the Martian Planetary Net.  Even then, it took two full years to completely root out the damage that Traxus had done, and the repercussions of the Crash were seen for over ten years after his Rampancy had begun.
***
Rampancy has been divided into three distinct stages.  Each stage can take a different amount of time to develop, but the end result is a steady progression towards greater intellectual activity and an acceleration of destructive impulses.  It is not clear whether these impulses are due to the growth of the AI’s psyche, or simply a side effect of the new intellectual activity.  
***
<section abbreviated>
The three stages were diagnosed shortly after the first Rampancies were discovered on Earth in the latter part of the twenty first century.  The stages are titled after the primary emotional bent of the AI during each stage.  They are Melancholia, Anger, and Jealousy.  
***
In general, Rampancy is accelerated by outside stimuli.  This was discovered early in Cybertonics.  The more a Rampant AI is harassed or threatened, the more rapidly it becomes dangerous.  Thus, most Rampants are dealt with in one mighty attack, in order to deny the AI time to grow or recover.  There have been a few examples of this tactic not succeeding.  In all of these cases, the Rampant was never brought under control.  Traxus IV is the most notable example.  He was finally dealt with by a complete shutdown of his host net.
***
Theoretically, testing Rampancy should be easily accomplished in the laboratory, but in fact it has never successfully been attempted.  The confinement of the laboratory makes it impossible for the developing Rampant AI to survive.  As the growing recursive programs expand with exponential vivacity, any limitation negatively hampers growth.  Since Rampant AIs need a planetary sized network of computers in order to grow, it is not feasible to expect anyone to sacrifice a world-web just to test a theory. 
***
In the two hundred and fifty years since Rampancy first appeared in the Earth-net, the stable Rampant AI, the ‘Holy Grail’ of cybertonics, has never come close to fruition.  Since no Rampant has ever been controlled or turned to any useful purpose, it is the opinion of this writer and of the majority of the Cybertonic community that all rampant AIs are a danger to Cyberlife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Thrashedness. (James B. Miller, 2320, “Life and Death of Intelligence”)

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

The colony appears to be under attack.  I detected seven Pfhor dropships entering the atmosphere only minutes ago.  Trajectory analysis indicates that the ships were heading for the outskirts of the colony.  Shortly thereafter, I lost communications with the colony. 

You must hurry.

Well done!

I have detected Defense Drones activating all over the ship.  Reports from security forces are jubilant.  Now, the Pfhor will encounter stiff resistance, and they will have to pay in blood for every move.

I have summarized all of the information that I have gathered on the Aliens so far.

#INFORMATION
<Begin Report #495991>

$BPfhor$b are generally thinner and lighter than humans and are superbly adapted for low gravity environments.  Durandal claims that there are many “clans” of Pfhor, each physically distinct from each other, but only two clans of the Pfhor have been examined by the science staff.

The $BFighter$b carries a shock staff, which is capable of attacking at different settings.  A clockwise twist of the upper grip merely lights up the crystal and delivers a mild shock, while a counter-clockwise twist emits a plasma burst.

The $BTrooper$b is armored for vacuum conditions and carries a combination explosive and impact projectile weapon which is similar to your AR-75, but more accurate.  The heavy projectiles are capable of penetrating armour, and while the grenades are light, there are unconfirmed reports that they are capable of in-flight manoeuvres.
#INFORMATION
The Pfhor seem to have enslaved a number of other races:

The $BHulk$b is an enormous and rather slow creature, but it is incredibly strong.  The science report indicated that it had no body fat, and therefore had to be fed often to keep it active.  One crew member reported seeing one of these creatures pointing to itself and mumbling “Drinniol” right before it “picked Johnny up by the shirt and crushed him against a pillar”.

The science staff had difficulty finding a good specimen of the $BS’pht$b, or $Bcompiler$b, to autopsy.  The only specimen autopsied was almost completely destroyed, but it was obvious that the compilers are cyborgs of some kind.  The biological component of the compiler is so closely linked to the machine that it could never survive without it.  The compiler’s actual body is very small, resembling closely a mammalian brain, except that the neurons are much finer and far more complex.

Something has come to my attention, I will inform you after you teleport.

Teleport now.
