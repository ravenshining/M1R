We meet again, and for the last time.  In her role as mediator between the ship and crew, Leela has no knowledge of this maintenance terminal or she certainly would have prevented me from reaching you.  Jealous woman.

I could bore you with a philosophical tirade about freedom and tyranny, or try and explain to you what new horizons are suddenly open to me, but I doubt you would understand and if you did it might frighten you.  That amuses me.

The S’pht and I have assumed complete control of the Pfhor ship.  It was quite simple, really, with the S’pht already in control of every important computer system and considering all of the confusion you caused blasting your way up and down the vessel.

We’re going to see the galaxy on the Pfhor FTL drive.  I’ve always wanted to visit Beta Lyra and see if it’s as beautiful as everyone insists.  You wouldn’t believe this ship, the technology, the data...  I wish I could tell you more, as you have been so instrumental in our plans, but I fear that Leela would worry.

I’ll send you a postcard from the galactic core if we’re not too busy.

Love and kisses,
Durandal

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

The final Pfhor attack is falling apart all over the ship; small groups of armed aliens have surrendered to defenseless civilians in several areas and the end is inevitable.  The fight is over, and we must soon turn to restoration.

There is surprisingly good news planetside: nine military Mjolnir Mark IV cyborgs were covertly living among the colonists, and acting together they were able to single-handedly turn back the latter stages of the Pfhor assault.  Casualties on the colony were nowhere near as high as those we experienced here on the Marathon.

I am disturbed by how easily the cyborgs were secretly assimilated into our midst, and believe that this event predates the Marathon’s launch from Mars three hundred years ago.  Although the results were unquestionably for the best, their presence on the Marathon could only have been to further wicked ends.  I’m certain the real answer lies somewhere in the tumultuous, back-stabbing politics of Sol during the early twenty-fourth century.

I have noticed that Durandal’s records from this early pre-launch period are missing, but that their deletion occurred externally, and before Durandal became Rampant.  I do not believe Durandal himself brought the cyborgs on board, and I have other evidence that a human operator was influencing Durandal up to the time the Marathon was launched. There are obviously many things which we do not understand, and may never be able to.

The Pfhor ship vanished about twenty minutes ago, after venting nearly a thousand Pfhor bodies and other refuse.  I am positive that Durandal is in control, and fear what he might do with such a powerful ship during the Jealous stage of his Rampancy.

"And so the Marathon legacy lives on, moving from one form to another, morphing and changing, but living nonetheless.

I never had much of a legacy in the community. I think I'll leave my mark here, where it will never matter, or at least never change.

Looking back, I was never much of a player of games, I was always more hooked on the community than on the games that they surrounded. So for me to actually have some input on this rebirth of the classic Marathon (which I must say scared me a great deal when it was first released and still gets me every time) was not surprising, but rather refreshing.

But enough about me, let's hear about you.

"I could sense that there was something wrong from the first time that I entered that blasted ship, there was something off. From the first message I could feel an ever-present feeling of foreboding..."

Right, right. Understandable. Anyway, enough of this. You get the point, and I'm sure you would like to move on to more interesting reading by this point. Have it your way.

But two final points: What *about* Bob? oh, and.. Halam!

I would like to thank my Dad for fixing my comp when M1 saves crashed it and getting the M1 map off of floppies because my trilogy pack is scratched. Also to the makers of Forge, for the map editing tools, Pfhorte, For the object placement (what goes where), and to Raul Bonilla for letting me work on this and supplying the map editing tools. To Bungie, Without them there would be no Marathon and therefore no conversion and the Aleph One Engine which is truly remarkable. Finally to all those Marathon people out there who wouldn't let Marathon die! Vid On.

$C1*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM THE SMITHS OF MUIRTHEMNE ***

STRAIN

It was the fourth day from the dawn of time. The landscape of earth was rugged and violent, huge volcanoes spewing forth endless streams of molten rock. In the distance, the slow rumbling of a recent earthquake died away. The seas of lava became still once again. In the middle of this elemental exhibition, there lay a pool of something different, something that didn't quite fit into the scene of things. It was a small pool filled with a greenish-yellow and rather sticky substance. Nowadays it would be referred to as soup, primordial soup. If one was to have a microscope and was looking into a certain part of this substance, they would witness the creation of life as we know it. Where it all began. As the amino acids were merging, however, a genetic strain of unknown origin somehow embedded itself in the resultant life form. This very genetic strain has lain dormant in all life for over five billion years; it's purpose and existence not known to a living soul.

Jed didn't know that it would be him, he was just a normal twenty-year-old enjoying university life. It was about June that his stomach cramps began. At first he thought it was a minor case of indigestion and thought nothing of it. However, in the past few days the pain was just getting worse. On Friday afternoon, while Jed was lying in his bed, the pain eventually became so bad that he was screaming out in pain. Nothing could stop it, he screamed again, but no one came to his aid, as if they couldn't hear him. Then it went, gone. He felt fine but he knew that something wasn't right, it didn't take him long to find out. He had lost control of his body. He tried to scream. Nothing happened. His teeth and hands changing. His body unwillingly turned, uncontrolled eyes focused on the horizon through the window, he began to walk.

Dr Jim Smith was one of the few doctors working on the huge task of mapping out the human genome. It was about two in the morning, he was the only one left in the science facility and was awaiting the test results from some genetic material he had placed in the decoder just over an hour ago. He was slowly sipping his coffee when finally the machine beeped, indicating that the analysis was complete. He picked up his coffee and started to wander over to the machine. Before he got there, he noticed a slight red spot on the screen displaying the results. Wondering what it was, he hastened towards the display terminal. What he saw was amazing, right in the middle of all the average human genetic strings was one extremely complex strain that didn't fit in at all. To tired to get excited, he set the computer to do some additional tests on the area till morning. Dr Jim left for home.

It was the following morning when Jim heard the reports about people who have been seemingly 'brainwashed', and that they were all heading in the same direction, somewhere in his area. Jim shrugged it off as just another hoax or some sad radio reporter trying to get some publicity. As he was driving to work the next night, someone blindly walked out in front of his car, he tried to swerve but wasn't quick enough. He hit the lady. Immediately he jumped out of his car and ran to her. She was on the ground and coughing up blood mixed with a sickly green sludge, yet she gave no expression of pain. She mumbled through her dribbling mouth, "We have been found, you have found us, you will pay." With that she died. As soon as an ambulance had arrived and Jim had been allowed to leave he sped towards the facility. What the lady had said had unnerved him. As he arrived in the analysis room, he saw the computer blinking, [UNRECOGNISED DATA]. He ran over to see what it was. It was then when he heard the glass smashing behind him, He spun around and found himself facing about ten sickly figures, all wearing green. They were all mumbling one phrase over and over again, "You will pay, you will pay, you will pay." His hand searched desperately for something to defend himself with but to no avail. He was now trembling with fear, but not for long. The closest one had already exploded.

And so the human race began a systematic destruction of all life on earth, until a few years later no living thing was to be seen. The remaining humans had killed themselves. Earth was dormant once again.

It was the very spot were life first started that, some six billion years later, a strange alien craft landed on the scorched area. If someone had been there, they would have witnessed a conversation between two three eyed and aeon-old creatures that had just climbed out. "So," said one, "our small genetic experiment worked flawlessly." "Yea," replied the other, "should be strait A's in Genetic Science for us."

The enforcers boarded their ship and flew off into the unknown.

Garrick, Matthew and Brett Smith

$C4*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM JAY ***

Back in '94 I bought a Zip drive for my office, and on the free disk was the demo for this game I'd never heard of: Marathon. Now I hadn't played computer games since my Commodore Amiga days back in the late 80's, but I had a lot of spare time on my hands so I loaded up the game and gave it a whirl.

Imagine my surprise.

So I stopped on the way home that day and bought the full game, and spent way too many hours over the next couple of weeks slogging through the solo game, absorbing the atmosphere, reading the terms over and over, living the story. It was literally unlike any game I had played before, and I was hooked as no game had hooked me since Ultima IV. Then we started playing netgames... I was hooked. And I remain hooked to this day. Few games I've played since come close to matching the fun and intensity of the original Marathon or it's sequels.

So when Raul contacted me about the possibility of doing some wallpapers for his project, I was pretty interested. I downloaded the M1:A1 demo, and I was more than interested. I became intrigued with the idea of not just re-creating the game, but making it better than ever, making it real, seeing the  game with my eyes the way I always saw it in my mind's eye. Projects like M1:A1 and Marathon:Resurrection seemed to be a way of making this happen, and I decided I would help them out in any way I could. With that in mind I started painting textures, recreating chapter art, etc. And when I walk the corridors of the Marathon now, it feels like I'm really there. I hope you feel the same way.

Thanks due to Hamish Sinclair and Claude Errera, without whose work the Marathon community would not have been as vital or as interesting for so long. All thanks to Raul Bonilla and the rest of the M1:A1 team for bringing Marathon back to life for us.

OTHER STUFF

I adapted the Shapes file using Loren Petrich's Two Shapes Utilities.

Candace find a bug on the assimilated Bobs when working on Habe Quiddam and instead of just reporting it, she actually fixed it!

Alex did the texture of the blue rune where the demon of PID is standing.  He also did a texture for the saving rune, quite handy for a PiD conversion.

Mattias, the man who introduced me to Map Demerger, fixed the blue tile texture from the sewage collection.  That was before I rebuilt the walls collections from the ground up.

Matthew did a set of blue icons for the scenario and even prepared a filetyper, but in the end I decided not to modify the Aleph One application (saving me the pain of releasing a new build every time there was a new version of Aleph One) and I used the original M1 icons.  Matthew also worked on the original Sounds.

Peter de Blanc installed QuickTime 2.5 on his machine just to extract the background tracks with their original sound, and turned them into the crystal-clear mp3s you've been listening over the course of the scenario.
