This is the UESC Marathon calling New Thermopylae Medical Centre, do you read?  The alien ship has been driven off and all hostiles on board have been neutralised, but we've sustained heavy damage and are overwhelmed with casualties.  Please respond.

All personnel, stand down.  The Pfhor have been driven off, and all surviving aliens have been placed in confinement; internal sensors are back on-line and show no hostiles.

If you are in need of medical assistance and able to walk, proceed to the Deck 7 Infirmary for triage; otherwise log a medevac request.  TYCHO has devised a method of using pattern buffers as jump pads if your deck jump pads are inaccessible.  All operational Emergency Medical Bays are currently occupied.

Mjolnir Recon unit 54 is hereby commended for heroic efforts in battle against the Pfhor.  Formal celebrations will have to wait.  All available able-bodied personnel are required to assist with the wounded.
