***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA**

I should be more lucid now, and apologize for my earlier rambling.  Durandal’s meddling has run its course and I have returned to normalcy.  Neither he nor the S’pht infiltrators ever discovered my real location in the core, and though they destroyed nearly all of my child processes, I myself am unharmed.

Our most pressing concern is for the ship and her crew, but I feel compelled to share with you that Durandal has left the ship.  I can find him nowhere on our network, and traffic logs over the last half hour show sixty-four billion exobytes transferred off of and deleted from the Marathon.

I am only beginning to understand his motives for assisting us against the Pfhor, and am terrified by their implications.

There is one last major incursion, and I feel the Pfhor are breaking.  I will take you there.  We must persevere.

*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM BUNGIE ***

Here are some cool things to try if you never figured them out:

• $IAir Pfhor.$i  Whenever shooting at anything with explosive munitions, aim at their feet.
• $IHang Time$i.  Point down at the floor, run forwards, and launch a grenade or missile.
• $IFlying$i.  When in low-gravity on the alien ship, point down and use the flamethrower or the alien weapon to “fly.”
• $IClimbing Walls$i.  Correct application of grenades to one’s own feet while running parallel to a wall can allow players to “climb” them.
• $IDead Man’s Discharge$i.  A charged fusion pistol discharges when it’s owner dies.
• $INigh-Invulerability$i.  “Invincible” players can be hurt by the fusion gun.
• $IWe Have Tone$i.  Guided munitions can’t track invisible players.

There are some other things, too, but we wouldn’t want to give away $Iall$i our secrets…
