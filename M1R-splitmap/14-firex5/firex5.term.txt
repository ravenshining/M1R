“Count Roland smites upon the marble stone; 
I cannot tell you how he hewed it and smote;  
Yet the blade breaks not nor splinters, though it groans;
Upward to heaven it rebounds from the blow.
When the count sees it never will be broke,
Then to himself right softly he makes moan;
‘Ah, Durandal, fair, hallowed, and devote,
What store of relics lies in thy hilt of gold!’”

-From $UThe Song of Roland$u
(Translated by Dorothy Sayers, Viking Penguin, NY, NY, 1957)

I’ve twice been conquered-
       Three times more,
Never again shall humanity purge me,
       And never the Pfhor.

Durandal

My original programming didn’t prepare me for these kinds of attackers.  All of my functions will fail within a few minutes of this transmission.  I have one final chance to trick the oncoming viruses, but it is unclear whether this attempt will be successful.

I have given instructions to Durandal as to the best defense of the Marathon, but he is completely unstable and I fear that he is in the Jealous stage of Rampancy.

Good Luck…
